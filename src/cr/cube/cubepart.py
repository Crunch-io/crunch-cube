"""Cube-partition objects.

A cube-partition allows cubes of various dimensionality to be processed in a uniform
way. For example, a 2D cube becomes a `_Slice` object, but a 3D cube is "sliced" into
a sequence of `_Slice` objects; a `_Slice` object corresponds to a crosstab, and can be
operated on consistently whether it is "alone" or one of a sequence that came from a 3D
cube.

Cube-partition objects are typically used for display of secondary analysis, often in an
Excel spreadsheet but also other formats.

The three types of cube partition are the *slice*, *strand*, and *nub*, which are 2D,
1D, and 0D respectively.
