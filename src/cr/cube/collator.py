"""Objects related to ordering the elements in a dimension.

There are several different collation (ordering) methods, each of which has a distinct
collator class here. Each has the single public (class)method `.display_order()` which
returns a tuple of signed int indices. A positive index refers to a base (non-inserted)
element and a negative index refers to an inserted subtotal. Both positive and negative
indices work for accessing the specified vector from the payload-order collection of
base vectors and inserted vectors, respectively.
