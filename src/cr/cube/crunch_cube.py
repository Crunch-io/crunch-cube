    '''Implementation of the CrunchCube API class.

    Class is used for the implementation of the main API functions that are
    needed for seamless integration with the crunch cube responses
    (from Crunch.io platform).

    Main API functions are:
      - as_array
      - margin
      - proportions
      - percentages

    These functions are used to retrieve statistical information of interest,
    from the JSON like crunch cubes. Complete usage of each API function is
    described within the appropriate docstring.

    Crunch Cubes contain richer metadata than standart Python objects, and
    they also conceal certain complexity in the data structures from the user.
    In particular, Multiple Response variables are generally represented as
    single dimensions in result tables, but in the actual data, they may
    comprise of two dimensions. These methods (API) understand the subtleties
    in the Crunch data types, and correctly compute margins and
    percentages off of them.
